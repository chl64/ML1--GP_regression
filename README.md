# Regression using different Gaussian Processes (GP)

Given a dataset of 1D continuous-valued input-output pairs `cw1a.mat`, Gaussian Process models with **different covariance functions** were individually fit to the data and their performance compared with respect to **marginal likelihood**. For each model, its hyper-parameters had been chosen to maximise the marginal likelihood, so as to avoid overfitting.
